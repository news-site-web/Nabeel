Lionel Messi: Barcelona president confident Argentina forward will stay at club
***************************************
The 33-year-old Argentina forward scored twice as runners-up Barcelona thrashed Alaves 5-0 on the final day of La Liga, landing him the division's top scorer's award for a record seventh time.
"Messi has said many times that he wants to retire here and I have no doubt that he will re-sign," Barca president Bartomeu told Mundo Deportivo.
Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar has been linked with a return to Nou Camp but Bartomeu said the only way for Barcelona to sign the Brazil forward would be through a player exchange.
