      <p class="card-text">
 "It's not a question of what shape you're in when you get infected," the Bulgarian, who contracted the coronavirus during the Adria Tour, expressed over the weekend.
Grigor Dimitrov says he's "lucky to be <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">on court right now," with the Bulgarian still experiencing physical effects despite recovering from coronavirus. 

Dimitrov, who announced he had the virus following his appearance at the Adria Tour five weeks ago, just returned to play in the UTS in France. He said he had breathing problems during the illness and is still getting back in shape.

"The movement is getting better," he told Tennis Majors. "Everything else is kind of going in the right direction, but still not easy to I think recover. The virus was hard on me, I stayed home for about a month. Tired, all the symptoms, everything you could think, so it was no fun.

"I'm just trying to put effort every day right now."

Dimitrov also spoke of the mental challenge of the isolation required during the illness, which added to the difficulty. "You're alone for about 20 days... We should not underestimate the power of the mental state," he said, urging others to follow protocols.

"If we take the right precautions, things will get better."
He also told L'Equipe the ways he had been impacted physically, dropping around six pounds and experiencing a sharp drop in cardiovascular fitness despite being a young, fit athlete.

"It's not a question of what shape you're in when you get infected," he said.

Consequently, he indicated he is unlikely to play the US Open. 

"For everyone, there are a lot of questions, and few answers," Dimitrov said. "For myself, there's also the physical aspect. Mentally, I could. But to put back three kilos of weight in three weeks, play Cincinnati and the US Open, five sets... it seems to me that's a little ambitious.

"There are days when I am good and where I can practice for a long time, and others where I'm tired a lot.".</span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>THE RALLY: WHAT CAN THE US OPEN LEARN FROM TENNIS' TEACHABLE MOMENTS?</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">



rom Novak Djokovic to Alexander Zverev to Danielle Collins, tennis has had plenty of mistakes demonstrating that nobody should feel they are above the rules.
Hi Joel,

We’ve heard that the pandemic will spur <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">all kinds of innovations, but I’m not sure that putting cardboard cut-outs of fans in the bleachers at sporting events will go down as an historic breakthrough. Would you want to have a photo of your smiling, or screaming, face in the crowd at a tennis tournament?

But this is where we are in the summer of 2020. Increasingly, it’s hard to tell whether we’re getting closer to bringing sports back or farther away.

On the plus side, World TeamTennis (WTT) has put on a safe event at The Greenbrier in West Virginia so far. There are encouraging early signs that the bubbles created by the NBA and MLS in Florida are holding, which should be good news for the US Open. Last week Major League Baseball had its long-delayed Opening Day. Next Monday, the WTA will kick off its 2020 season, for real, in Palermo, Italy. The week after that, Serena Williams is scheduled to return to the court for the first time at a tournament in Kentucky.
On the minus side, the Citi Open, which was set to begin the summer circuit in the U.S., has been cancelled, as have all fall tournaments in China. Travel restrictions—from continent to continent, country to country, and even state to state—are proving difficult to overcome. The biggest problem may be the U.S. itself, which is digging a deeper COVID-19 hole even as much of Europe and Asia opens up. Can an international tennis tour function without a safe and functioning United States?

(Editor's Note: after publishing this story, it was reported that the Miami Marlins organization has suffered a significant COVID-19 outbreak. Following four confirmed cases among players Sunday, it was reported that one third of the traveling roster (11/33) has now tested positive, along with two coaches. Two games scheduled for this evening, including Miami's home opener, were subsequently canceled). 

For our purposes, the big question is whether the US Open will, or should, be played in New York next month. Again, the signs are conflicting. The state’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, wants the Open to happen, but we also learned last week that another major international event normally held in New York in late summer, the United Nations General Assembly, has been canceled.

As a fan, it can be hard to know how to feel about watching sports, or even wanting to watch sports, during a pandemic. Are we asking athletes to take life-threatening risks for our entertainment? Does the need to restart professional leagues expose them as unadulterated money-making ventures? For the most part, having seen what happened in NYC this spring, and then at the Adria Tour in Croatia, I’ve favored caution. The fastest way back to normality for all of us is to contain the virus. But I’ve been encouraged by WTT’s success so far. Maybe bubbles, like the one the US Open is proposing, can work.</span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>KENIN EAGER FOR A SECOND CHANCE AT FACING HER IDOL CLIJSTERS IN WTT</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">


White Sulphur Springs, W. Va.—Sofia Kenin got a chance to face her idol Kim Clijsters in World TeamTennis action earlier this season and it didn't go the way she wanted. Now she's eager<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> for a second chance. 

On July 15, New York Empire's Clijsters would beat Kenin 5-3, helping her team top Philadelphia 25-17. Kenin said the experience of facing the four-time Grand Slam champion was different than what she expected.

She'd met Clijsters before, as a five-year-old trailing her at the Miami Open in the now-famous video, and in Dubai for media obligations earlier this year. But she had not seen her across from the net, and never expected to. 

"When I found out she was coming back I was super excited," the 21-year-old says. "Of course, I wanted to play her. It's good for us and for Fila. It's a great story. It brings back a lot of memories. There are a lot of things behind it."


Kenin, the highest-ranked female player at No. 4, has been strong for the top-ranked Freedoms. She's 8-3 in singles sets—complete with a win over Venus Williams—and her team is 9-2 on the season. Her loss to Clijsters was early in the season and the Belgian has been sidelined from singles since July 18 with injuries. 

"I guess my nerves got the better of me when I played her even though it's not a full match," Kenin said. "It was just a little bit different because I've always looked up to her."

Philadelphia has a rematch with New York on Thursday, but odds are that Kenin takes on CoCo Vandeweghe instead of Clijsters. Vandeweghe and her doubles partner Nicole Melichar were a late Sunday night trade from the San Diego Aviators to the New York Empire. Clijsters teammates Kveta Peschke and Sabine Lisicki are now Aviators. 

"Kim was the wild card," New York coach Luke Jensen says. "Lots of load management with three kids after nine years away. You know coming in she's extremely serious about this comeback to the tour and using this WTT season as a springboard to give her a lot of pressure competition. But seeing that it's day to day and the emotional [and physical] drain we are not really certain to have Clijsters in the lineup. We looked at options."

The deciding factor was Vandeweghe and Melichar impressing Jensen in their 5-3 win over Kenin and Taylor Townsend on Sunday night. The Aviators would lose and ultimately miss out on a chance at the playoffs. New York is currently fourth place and four teams qualify for Saturday's semifinal. 

Kenin is eager not to miss her next chance at Clijsters, who could be back in the singles lineup by the weekend (assuming New York qualifies). No matter who Kenin faces, she's going to bring her signature intensity, the asset that helped her win the 2020 Australian Open and that will hopefully help her win the King Cup for Philadelphia.
