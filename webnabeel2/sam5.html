      <p class="card-text">
 Lausanne, July 29, 2020 - Belgium's rising star Britt Herbots opened her heart to all her fans last week, when she featured in a live Facebook session, part of the FIVB Player of the Week series, as she returned<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> to Italy in preparation for the new season.

The 20-year-old, who moved to Igor Gorgonzola Novara last month, started by pointing out how happy she is to be back in Italy and preparing for the year ahead - and how much she looks forward to competing in the Italian League and the European Champions League.

Herbots picked out her fellow-Belgian Sam Deroo and Brazil's Gabi [Guimaraes] as her favourite male and female players and winning the European Champions League is amongst her top wishes.

She selected Gabi and China's Zhu Ting as outside hitters, Serbia's Milena Rasic and Stefana Veljkovic as middle blockers, Italy's Alessia Orro as setter, Sweden's Isabelle Haak as opposite and Italy's Monica De Gennaro as libero on her Dream Team.

In the almost 40-minute session Herbots reminisced on good and bad moments during her career, talked about her favourite places across the world and in Belgium, and mentioned how her family has played such an important role in her life and career.
Herbots went on to explain how she coped with lockdown after returning to Belgium to be close to her family, getting the chance to go on runs and riding her bike, as well as having a garden for all her workouts and following specific programmes through teleconferencing.</span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>ELI VASILEVA HAPPY WITH CHANCE TO PLAY AGAIN</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">


Plovdiv, Bulgaria, July 30, 2020 – Some four weeks after joining the training camp of the Bulgarian national team in Plovdiv, Elitsa Vasileva told fivb.com how happy she was with the chance to play volleyball<span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2"> again, after the long pandemic related lockdown.

In 2021, Bulgaria's biggest star and captain is set to lead the team through a campaign in the CEV European Golden League and potentially the FIVB Volleyball Challenger Cup, aiming at readmission to the elite club of teams in the FIVB Volleyball Nations League. Bulgaria also co-hosts the 2021 CEV European Championship, another challenge of high importance for the coach Ivan Petkov's Lionesses.

Bulgaria got close to qualifying for Tokyo 2020 when they were up 2-1 in a crucial intercontinental qualification match in the United States last August, but failed to deliver the big upset and book a ticket to next year’s Olympic Games.

Vasileva has played for top-level club teams from six different countries on three different continents, with the 2010 FIVB Volleyball Club World Championship bronze and the 2011 Italian championship title, both with the team of Norda Foppapedretti Bergamo, among the highest achievements of her club career. With her most recent club, Italy’s Igor Gorgonzola Novara, Eli Vasileva reached the semifinals of the 2019 Club World Championship.

In early July you joined the national team camp. What does it feel like to be in training again after such a long break? How much did you miss volleyball during the isolation?
Elitsa Vasileva: It feels very good. I am very happy for this opportunity to practice again and glad that they managed to schedule such a long training camp for us. In a way, this is a return to the pre-pandemic normality. At the beginning of the lockdown, I took it more as time to take some rest, but as time passed I started missing volleyball more and more, so now I am happy we have a chance to play again.

With some completely new players on the squad, how do you see the team's potential for future success?
Elitsa Vasileva: There really are a lot of young girls with talent and potential, but nothing can be achieved without lots of work. So it completely depends on them (and on us as a team) how hard we are going to work to achieve results.

One of the goals is obviously a good result at next year's CEV European Championship at home. Another main goal is probably the return to the FIVB Volleyball Nations League?
Elitsa Vasileva: Yes, these are our two main targets next year – no discussion. As far as our home EuroVolley, this is our first chance to compete at such a level in Bulgaria, and I think we will all approach it with great ambition. As far as the VNL, we definitely belong there, but it is up to us to prove it, to earn our spot, and then keep it for the years to come. It’s a long process, accompanied by a lot of work, but we have to establish ourselves as a permanent member of the League.</span></p>

      <p class="card-text">

Last June, Mojarad was chosen as a schools ambassador by the Ministry of Education of Iran. Minister Mohsen Jahi Mirzaei presented him with a plaque at a ceremony held in his hometown of Bojnord<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> in North Khorasan.

The 22-year-old ambassador will help raise funds to build schools and provide learning opportunities for underprivileged children in his country.

“In my new role as ambassador, I will try to help children exercise their fundamental right to education and eventually enable them to shape their own future,” Mojarad said.

“My goal is to create awareness and raise funds to build schools in the most marginalised areas.”
“My biggest achievement was with the senior team when we won gold at the Asian Championship and when we qualified to the final round of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Nations League.”

The middle blocker only began playing in his teens, but he was a natural as volleyball runs in his blood. He did, however, have to overcome the obstacle of moving from a small city to a big city.</span></p>
