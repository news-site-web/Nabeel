ALIASGHAR MOJARAD PROMOTING EDUCATION
**************************

Last June, Mojarad was chosen as a schools ambassador by the Ministry of Education of Iran. Minister Mohsen Jahi Mirzaei presented him with a plaque at a ceremony held in his hometown of Bojnord in North Khorasan.

The 22-year-old ambassador will help raise funds to build schools and provide learning opportunities for underprivileged children in his country.

“In my new role as ambassador, I will try to help children exercise their fundamental right to education and eventually enable them to shape their own future,” Mojarad said.

“My goal is to create awareness and raise funds to build schools in the most marginalised areas.”
“My biggest achievement was with the senior team when we won gold at the Asian Championship and when we qualified to the final round of the 2019 FIVB Volleyball Nations League.”

The middle blocker only began playing in his teens, but he was a natural as volleyball runs in his blood. He did, however, have to overcome the obstacle of moving from a small city to a big city.
