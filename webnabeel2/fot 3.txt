Mariano Diaz has tested positive for coronavirus, casting doubt on his participation in Real Madrid's Champions League tie at Manchester City on August 7.

Real said tests were conducted on the squad on Monday and though the 26-year-old Dominican international Diaz was in "perfect health", he would be self-isolating at home.
The Spanish club announced via a statement: "After the Covid-19 tests carried out individually on our first team yesterday by the Real Madrid Medical Services, our player Mariano has given a positive result.

"The player is in perfect health and complying with the sanitary isolation protocol at home."


Mariano was a long shot to face City to begin with, having been a fringe player for Madrid this season. He has made only seven appearances this campaign, five of them as a substitute in La Liga, and has not appeared in a Champions League matchday squad.

Nevertheless, UEFA has released a statement saying they are confident the game will go ahead as planned despite Diaz's positive test.

It read: "UEFA is in contact with the club and monitoring both the situation and decisions of the relevant Spanish authorities.
