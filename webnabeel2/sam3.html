      <p class="card-text">
USA Swimming has finalized the time standards for the first two stops of the 2020-2021 Pro Swim Series, which is scheduled to kick off on November 5th in Richmond, Virginia

The meets, which will both feature<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> evening prelims sessions and morning finals sessions to mimic the Tokyo Olympic Schedule, will be bound by the 2021 U.S. Olympic Trials time standards.
These standards are considerably faster than the ones that were used to open last year’s Pro Swim Series meet in Greensboro. Those cuts were an expansion of even tougher cuts to start the prior season, which were then expanded due to low athlete attendance at the meets.

The new standards for this year’s opening meets are the fastest in the history of the PSS by a pretty significant margin (Knoxville in 2018 previously held that title).

These tougher standards position the Pro Swim Series as preparation events for the U.S. Olympic Trials. This year, the meets will be much less about “development” and much more about “making sure that the United States’ future Olympians have elite racing opportunities between now and Tokyo.”

By limiting the size of these meets, USA Swimming will also limit the number of athletes who have to travel to compete in them. Placing the first two meets on back-to-back weekends on opposite ends of the country should further limit the size, as that will mitigate the need for athletes to travel (or at least travel by plane) cross country to get to the meet.

Even further limitations could result if the International Swimming League is successful in launching its training-camp second season and is likewise able to persuade Americans to participate. That could pull a number of the country’s top swimmers away from the early Pro Swim Series stops.

In short: the expectations is that this year’s meets will be much smaller than last year’s were.

Both meets will be capped at ‘approximately 400 swimmers.’ By comparison, last year’s Greensboro meet was capped at ‘approximately 450 swimmers.’

USA Swimming has canceled the 14-16 targeted regional events that it had initially proposed for August. Those events will not be rescheduled. </span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>BOLLES SCHOOL SWIMMERS POST NATION-LEADING TIMES AT FIRST MEET SINCE SHUTDOWN</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">

The Bolles School in Florida hosted a meet this past weekend, its first after meets were shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic. During the meet, swimmers were split up into sessions according to practice <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">groups with the National, National Prep, and Champs groups competing. Due to this, the Sharks only had their 13 and over swimmers racing in the meet. 

Due to USA swimming restrictions, times posted during the meet cannot count towards qualification for any events above the LSC level. Despite this, the Bolles swimmers still posted 94 post-quarantine top 10 times, with several swimmers getting near or below their personal bests.

13 year-old John McNamara posted the top 13-14 year-old time in the country this season in the 100 breaststroke, finishing in a time of 59.93. The swim was also a personal best for McNamara, who dropped almost 3 seconds off of his entry time of 1:02.86. McNamara added to this by winning the 200 IM in a personal best 1:59.96, and by dropping a personal best 56.90 in the 100 fly, which was over a four second drop.

Joining McNamara in posting nation leading times were 16 year-olds Drew Salls and Tomohiro Nozaki, who both swam best times on the way to their top times.

Salls dropped over a second in his 100 freestyle to take the position as the top 15-16 swimmer in the country. His final time of 46.17 overtook his previous best by 1.31 seconds. He also swam a time of 21.58 in the 50 freestyle, ranking him 3rd in the country.

Nozaki swam a 1:54.69 in the 200 IM, which overtook his previous best time by over 6 seconds and now ranks him first in the country by over a half-second. Throughout the weekend, Nozaki dropped time in all 5 of the events he swam, putting his name on the top 10 list in all of them as well.</span></p>

      <p class="card-text">
Several Chinese national team members were in the water yesterday competing against one another in a closed competition before heading to a 3-week training camp.

A 3-day, unofficial meet is <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">being held in Shandong Province, with the likes of Xu Jiayu, Yan Zibei, and Ye Shiwen getting some swimming under their belts before their National Championships in the middle of next month.

Yesterday we saw Zhang Yufei bust out a monster fly split of 56.11 to help the mixed medley relay combination of Xu Jiayu, Yan Zibei and Yang Junxuan nearly unofficially beat the national record in the mixed event. The squad touched in a time of 3:40.56, just .12 shy of the 3:40.45 China put up for gold at the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta.

Competing in the individual 100m fly event on day 2 here in Shandong Province, Zhang was super strong once again, powering her way to a winning effort of 56.68.

Splitting 26.25/30.43, 22-year-old Zhang beat the field by nearly 2 seconds, although runner-up Wang Yichen put up a respectable time of 58.71 to represent the other swimmer under the minute mark in the final.

However, in the prelims, Zhang was even quicker, posting a morning swim of 56.47. Splits for that huge swim included 26.04/30.43 to give her the quickest time of her career.

Although Zhang’s time here is unofficial, it checks in as her lifetime best, crushing her previous PB of 57.29 from the 2017 World Championships. As such, today represents her first time ever under the 57-second threshold. Her morning outing here would have rendered Zhang as the bronze medalist in Gwangju last year, as opposed to 57.93 she registered in reality to place 13th.

Liu Zige has owned the Chinese national record in this women’s 100m fly since 2009, when she posted a 56.07 at the National Games over a decade ago. That still stands as the Asian continental record in the event, but Zhang made a major move among the all-time Asian performers, unofficially inserting herself into the 4th slot on the list.

In the men’s 100m breast, it was Sun Jiajun came out on top, touching in 59.53 for the only time under the minute barrier. Opening in 27.57 and closing in 31.96, the 2018 Youth Olympic Games gold medalist edged out Asian record holder Yan Zibei.

Yan wound up registering at a time of 1:00.68 for silver, with Zhang Ruixuan rounding out the top 3 in 1:01.49.

For 19-year-old Sun, this performance checks-in unofficially as his first venture ever under the 1:00 threshold. In Buenos Aires at the 2018 Youth Olympic Games, Sun put up a time of 1:00.59 for gold.</span></p>
