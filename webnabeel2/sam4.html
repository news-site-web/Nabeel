      <p class="card-text">
LeBron James vowed no let-up in the fight for social justice as the National Basketball Association's (NBA) coronavirus-hit season made an emotional return in Orlando on Thursday (July 30).

Los Angeles<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">  Lakers star James and players from the Los Angeles Clippers, Utah Jazz and New Orleans Pelicans all kneeled in unison during the US national anthem before their respective games in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

James, who scored the winning points for the Lakers in a 103-101 defeat of the Clippers, said players were determined to use their NBA platform to fight racism and police brutality.
At the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex, he followed his own miss and made the winning shot with 12.8 seconds left.

Anthony Davis scored 34 points and grabbed eight rebounds for the Lakers, and James finished with 16 points, 11 rebounds and seven assists. James struggled on 6-of-19 shooting.

Kyle Kuzma added 16 points for the first-place Lakers (50-14), who increased their lead to six and a half games over the second-place Clippers (44-21) in the Western Conference standings.

Paul George had 30 points for the Clippers, but he missed a three-point attempt at the final horn. Kawhi Leonard finished with 28 points, Patrick Beverley added 12 points, and Reggie Jackson added 10.

"This is an opportunity to use this platform to spread a lot of positives, a lot of love throughout the course of the whole world," James said.

"We understand what's going on in society right now and we're using this NBA platform as players as coaches and as an organisation to stand strong on that. This is a good start.

The United States saw nationwide protests in June following the death of unarmed black man George Floyd during his arrest by police in Minneapolis on May 25. Four officers were later charged over his death.

"We're dealing with a lot of racism, a lot of social injustice and police brutality," James said. "It's something that we want to have people's ears open to. We have ears open now, but we cannot stop.

"We'll keep our foot on the gas as we've been doing over the past two months."

New Orleans guard Jrue Holiday, meanwhile, said the anthem demonstration had been a unifying moment.

"It felt like we were able to bring people together," Holiday said. "Two teams, who were about to go out there to battle, we can also come together to fight for something, and I feel like that was huge.

"That's one of the reasons why I feel like (the players) came back and the league wanted us to come back."

Pelicans team-mate Zion Williamson agreed. "It was emotional because all of us (were) there together as one, doing something we believe in," he said.
In the first game of the restart, Rudy Gobert broke a tie by making two free throws with 6.9 seconds left, and the Jazz defeated the Pelicans 106-104.

The lead held up when Brandon Ingram missed a three-pointer with one second left, completing a fourth quarter in which the Jazz outscored the Pelicans 27-17.

The NBA had shut down play on March 11 due.</span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>Basketball: All you need to know about the NBA bubble as season restarts</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">

The National Basketball Association (NBA) relaunches its 2019-2020 season on Thursday (July 30) with 22 teams based inside a secure "bubble" at Disney World in Florida due to complete the remainder of the campaign <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">

Here AFP looks at some of the key questions and issues surrounding the unprecedented restart:

WHAT IS THE BUBBLE?
From the moment the NBA season was halted in March after the pandemic brought the United States to a standstill, the NBA began looking at the question of how or if the season could be restarted safely.
The logistical challenges of restarting the season in its existing format, with large travelling groups of players and support staff jetting in and out of multiple cities at a time was deemed a non-starter in the era of Covid-19.

Instead, the NBA began exploring the feasibility of basing all teams at a single location, creating a giant quarantined safe zone or "bubble" and completing the season there.

Las Vegas and Orlando quickly emerged as the front-runners, with the NBA eventually opting for the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida as the best venue.

Twenty-two teams are now based in the campus, with players requiring to test negative for Covid-19 twice after arrival before being allowed to enter.

WHO IS ALLOWED IN?
Team and NBA personnel are staying in three hotels dotted throughout the complex, with a small number of media, sponsors and inactive players. Games will take place without fans at three different venues on the complex.

In the early weeks of the restart, no guests will be allowed although those rules will be relaxed once the play-offs start.

After the first round of the play-offs, players will be allowed to reserve one hotel room each for guests, who will be required to self-quarantine for seven days. Any guests entering the bubble must also test negative twice for Covid-19 in the 72 hours before entering. Any guests testing positive will not be allowed to enter.
The regulations have already tripped up two NBA players - the Los Angeles Clippers' Lou Williams was ordered to serve a 10-day quarantine after visiting an Atlanta strip club during a family emergency leave.

Williams was photographed at an Atlanta strip club which he said he visited to get some take-out food.

Richuan Holmes of the Sacramento Kings was also hit with a 10-day quarantine order after leaving the campus to pick up a delivery of chicken wings.

LIFE IN THE BUBBLE
LeBron James joked that leaving his home to enter the bubble was like "heading to do a bid" - a slang term for starting a prison sentence.

But since arriving in Orlando, most players have adjusted to life in their tightly controlled environment. Many have installed creature comforts from home including giant televisions and video game consoles.

A Twitter account - @nbabubblelife - which documents the daily activities of NBA players based in Orlando has quickly amassed a large following, depicting players doing everything from getting haircuts to playing golf or fishing.

Despite being inside the bubble, players are still required to follow conventions such as social distancing and wearing face coverings. Players are also barred from entering each other's rooms.</span></p>

      <h5 class="card-title"><b>Irving bankrolls WNBA players' fund</b></h5>
      <p class="card-text">
Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving has pledged US$1.5 million (S$2.07 million) to provide financial support to Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) players who choose to sit out the season.

The 2016 National Basketball Association (NBA) champion<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> will distribute money from his newly created KAI Empowerment Initiative fund, a statement said on Monday.

Several players have already decided to opt out of the WNBA's shortened, 22-game regular season, with some citing concerns over Covid-19 or issues surrounding social justice reform.


Irving, who had expressed his reservations about the NBA returning to play amid the pandemic and widespread civil unrest in the United States, said he set up the programme after talks with WNBA players Natasha Cloud and Jewell Loyd. Washington Mystics star Cloud was one of the first players to opt out of the season.

"In these conversations I have learnt about the challenges and opportunities of their decisions and how it will impact their lives, family and overall well-being," the 28-year-old guard said in a statement. "This platform was created to provide support for all WNBA players in hopes to relieve some of the financial strain imposed during these challenging times."

The WNBA season started on Saturday, with all 12 teams playing at a single location at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida.

Irving is not with the Nets while they prepare to resume the NBA season as he recovers from shoulder surgery.
