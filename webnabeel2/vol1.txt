BRITT HERBOTS: "SUPER-GOOD TO BE BACK IN ITALY"
*******************
Lausanne, July 29, 2020 - Belgium's rising star Britt Herbots opened her heart to all her fans last week, when she featured in a live Facebook session, part of the FIVB Player of the Week series, as she returned to Italy in preparation for the new season.

The 20-year-old, who moved to Igor Gorgonzola Novara last month, started by pointing out how happy she is to be back in Italy and preparing for the year ahead - and how much she looks forward to competing in the Italian League and the European Champions League.

Herbots picked out her fellow-Belgian Sam Deroo and Brazil's Gabi [Guimaraes] as her favourite male and female players and winning the European Champions League is amongst her top wishes.

She selected Gabi and China's Zhu Ting as outside hitters, Serbia's Milena Rasic and Stefana Veljkovic as middle blockers, Italy's Alessia Orro as setter, Sweden's Isabelle Haak as opposite and Italy's Monica De Gennaro as libero on her Dream Team.

In the almost 40-minute session Herbots reminisced on good and bad moments during her career, talked about her favourite places across the world and in Belgium, and mentioned how her family has played such an important role in her life and career.
Herbots went on to explain how she coped with lockdown after returning to Belgium to be close to her family, getting the chance to go on runs and riding her bike, as well as having a garden for all her workouts and following specific programmes through teleconferencing.
